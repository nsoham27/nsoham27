## 👨‍💻 Developer Mindset: 
I don't just write code; I architect systems that last. From low-level C++ logic to complex middleware orchestration, I build software where performance and reliability are non-negotiable.

## 💡 Code Philosophy

> "Write code like you’re the one who has to debug it at 3 AM on a production server."

* **Fun Fact:** I've spent more time in a Linux terminal than in a browser. 🐧
* **Passion:** I believe a robust **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** is more satisfying than a quick fix.
